        Do arrays have methods?  == no
        Are arrays mutable? == yes
        "Arrays class" java.util contains the methods
        remember that java has docs.oracle.com


        Methods:
            Arrays.toString(arr);
                allow us to print arrays objects as Strings
                the array "arr" is the argument in the statement
            Arrays.sort(arr);
                accepts arr as an argument and sorts in alphabetical / numerical order
                aka ascending order
                this method does not have a return, it will sort the object
                has to be in a different line than printing.
                Sorts by: special char, numbers, upper case, then lower case
            Arrays.equals(arr, arr2);
                compare the data in the elements to see if it matches exactly
