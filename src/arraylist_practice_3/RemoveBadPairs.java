    Remove Bad Pairs
        Create a method that will accept an Integer ArrayList and check for
        bad pairs. A pair is an element and the element next to it.
        A bad pair is whenever the first number in the pair is bigger then
        the
        second number. Remove any bad pairs for the ArrayList and return
        the
        ArrayList with no bad pairs
        Note: The given ArrayList will always be an even number of
        elements, so each number always has one pair
        @param nums - Given ArrayList of numbers
        @return - ArrayList of numbers
