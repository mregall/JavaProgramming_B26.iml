Recap: Methods

    a group of statements that have some action and those actions become re-usable anywhere in the project

    2 types of methods:

        void: executes some action, but it doesn't give any information/value back

            public static void methodName(){

            }

        return: execute some actions, and it returns some value

            public static RETURN_TYPE methodName(){

            }

    parameters:

        allowing the method to get some data/information to use inside of the method

        parameters are defined in the parenthesis of a method
            --> to add multiple parameters use a comma and define:

                datatype name, datatype name, etc

        any parameter is local to that method

            ex:
                charAt(index)

                charAt(0)

                charAt --> method name
                (index) --> parameter, some information of this type must be given to run the method
                (0) --> the 0, or any other number given, is the argument - the actual value that will be used in the method code

return type

        public static RETURN_TYPE methodName(){

        }

        method that does an action, but it will return/give back a single value

        RETURN_TYPE: any type

        these method use the keyword:
            return

            -> this keyword with values is how we will get information out of the methods

        the return keyword also stops the method, because a value was passed out of it already
