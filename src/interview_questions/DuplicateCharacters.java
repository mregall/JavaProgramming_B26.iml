      /*  [IQ] Duplicate characters

        Given a String, find and print the duplicate characters. A character is duplicate if it appears more than once in the String.

        Ex:
        Input:
        AAABCCDEEF
        Output:
        ACE

                -> the characters A C and E are found in the String multiple times so they are duplicates
