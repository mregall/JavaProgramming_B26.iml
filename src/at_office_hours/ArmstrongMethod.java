    Task 4 :   Write a method that can check if a number is Armstrong number

				Note: if I have a 3-digit number then each of the digits is raised to the power of three and added to obtain a number. If the number obtained equals the original number then, we call that armstrong number.


                print all the armstrong numbers with three digit
				Armstrong numbers are     === 153 370 371 407 === for 3 digits

				 153   ==  (1*1*1)+(5*5*5)+(3*3*3)
                             1       125      27  == 153
